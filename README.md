# CardCastle
_A creative sandbox for developing a collectible card strategy game._

### Rule # 1 : Have fun!
### Rule # 2 : You make the rules!

#### Overview
_...and the name of the game shall be that which they hath cast as dice before thine own eyes..._
_...drawn from the deck of cards as splinters from a ship roiling upon the seas of fate..._

### How many cards, you ask? Why, how many splinters form the ship?

### Which way to sail? We shall find our way over water by following the fire of the stars throught the sky to the earthen refuges... In time.

### But "What's in it for you", well, only through mutual attention will true connection be acquired. Bring your friends!

### I can understand you are wary of offending the little ones, and fret not, my consciencious fellow, we shall shepherd the flock of ducklings with a newly-aware sense of equally-shared responsibility.

### But yes, as you suggest, there will be the requirement of just _how_ to settle any disagreements that might, could, and will arise. _Best to be prepared_.

### To allay your fears, take heart in the outpouring of art that is the _destiny_ of this endeavor. After all, we must needs express ourselves, must we not?

What follows now is the recursive, and oft circuitously so, discourse regarding a variety of experiences, preferences, half-learned jargon, leery lingo, and tritely put, _other things_. 
Let not the lack of specificity eat away a node of doubt that begets worry that begets panic, that begets... well, you beget the drift... 
_Henceforth we shall dispense with such nonsense._

What cards may come...
What numbers may numb...
What games be played...
Be named and made.


And, for those about to mock, we recruit you.
